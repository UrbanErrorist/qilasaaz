        was started in 1992-93 in the fort (Qila) of Mahmudabad, Uttar Pradesh, 
        India. Its principal purpose is to enable women to earn a viable income 
        through their traditional and distinctive skills in embroidery and sewing. 
        It was hoped that these skills, which constitute a veritable and vanishing 
        art form, would also be preserved through this process.</font></strong></font></p>
      <p  align="justify"><font color="FBECCB"><strong><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many 
          of the women associated with Qilasaaz were connected, through links extending 
          over several generations, with the household of the Raja of Mahmudabad. 
          Within this context, they had acquired skills that were deployed in the 
          making of quilts, traditional clothes and various other handicrafts. The 
          changes that affected the life of the Qila led to the demand for these 
          traditional work patterns becoming unreliable and the skills therefore 
          increasingly precarious. The result was especially poignant for women 
          who had relied on this work, and who were the repositories of these skills. 
          Not with standing 
          the explosion in textile design in India over the last decades, Qilasaaz 
          has managed to secure a respectable livelihood for the women associated 
          with it. In the process it has also helped to consolidate and encourage 
          the viability of these unique skills. It has now entered a new phase.

      <p align="justify"><font color="#F5ECCF"><strong><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is regular employment for twenty women, and occasional employment 
            for more than fifty. There has been a significant enhancement of other 
            skills, such as book-keeping and financial management, among some of the 
            women. Moreover they now seek the best available medical facilities for 
            their families, and for their children to go to the best available schools.</font></strong></font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#F5ECCF"><strong><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Qilasaaz 
        has met the challenge of its original mission. We hope that in this new 
        phase it will continue to serve the needs of these women, while remaining 
    true to the imperatives of a local and unique art form.</font></strong></font></p></td>
